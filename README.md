## Changes from last submission
* Created 'Inventory' table/entity with book_id, employee_id, quantity, and restock_threshold
* Deleted the 'Publisher' table/entity
* Added the publisher's respective fields onto the 'Book' table
## Other important notes
* We kept the 'Person' table/entity that many of the entities reference because we argue that it is good practice to abstract away commonalities between similar tables/entities
